class Customer(obj): # class that defines a customer
    # a customer of ABC Bank with a checking account. Customers have the following attributes:
    # 1. Customers have a name: a string representing the customer's name
    # 2. Customers have a balance: a float tracking the current balance of the customer's account

    def __init__(self, name, balance=0.0): # initializing the Customer class
        # describing the customer
        self.name = name # creates the name for the customer
        self.balance = balance # creates the `balance` for the customer

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        # returning a balance remaining after withdrawing `amount` dollars.
        if amount > self.balance: # if the parameter `amount` is greater than balance from init
            raise RuntimeError ("Amount greater than available balance.") # print insufficient balance message
        self.balance -= amount # else remove `amount` from balance
        return self.balance # return the value

    def deposit(self, amount):
        # returning a balance after `amount` is added
        self.balance += amount
        return self.balance
